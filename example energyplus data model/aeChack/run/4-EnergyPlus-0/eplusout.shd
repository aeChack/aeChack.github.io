..In the following, only the first 10 reference surfaces will be shown.
..But all surfaces are used in the calculations.
 ==================================
 Surface=SURFACE 2 is used as Receiving Surface in calculations and is convex.
 Number of general casting surfaces=           0
 Number of back surfaces=           0
 Number of receiving sub surfaces=           1
 ....Surface=SUB SURFACE 1
 ==================================
 Surface=SUB SURFACE 1 is not used as Receiving Surface in calculations.
 Number of general casting surfaces=           0
 Number of back surfaces=           0
 Number of receiving sub surfaces=           0
 ==================================
 Surface=SURFACE 3 is used as Receiving Surface in calculations and is convex.
 Number of general casting surfaces=           0
 Number of back surfaces=           0
 Number of receiving sub surfaces=           0
 ==================================
 Surface=SURFACE 5 is used as Receiving Surface in calculations and is convex.
 Number of general casting surfaces=           0
 Number of back surfaces=           0
